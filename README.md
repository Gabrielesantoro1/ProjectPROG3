# ProjectPROG3
A Java project developed for the Programming III course, attended in 2020/2021.
It simulates a client-server email system with a simple user-like GUI.
The project had to work only locally.
We mainly had to use socket/server socket management, multi threading coding, JavaFXML(Scene Builder), and I/O methods.
